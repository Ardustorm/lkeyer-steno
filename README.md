LKeyer is my attempt at designing a simple Steno machine that is cheap and easy to make. The code is written by [CharleyShattuck](https://github.com/CharleyShattuck/Steno-Keyboard-Arduino). This is still a work in progress. Eventually I would love to replace the arduino with a raspberry pi zero and create a standalone steno machine, but one step at a time.
